##Project Description:
My assignment will be a time-study tool. This will enable users to use a time clock to time workers from beginning to end, list their stop times, and totals. From there, there will be an option given to give you your average, your productivity per hour, etc. If possible, I will also be adding functionality to input an entire shift's work time, allowing time for lunch, breaks, and down time.

### Features
* Stopwatch interface 
* MAMP Database 
* User authentication/profiles

### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn more about project tracking, user authentication, and front-end/back-end authentication; I'll also have to learn more on the spring network to ensure I can implement everything on the stopwatch;
